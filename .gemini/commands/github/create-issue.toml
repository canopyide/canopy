Create a structured GitHub issue for the **Canopy** project.

**Context:** {{args}}

### Step 1: Analyze Request

1. **Understand Work**: Determine if the request is a Bug (`fix`), Feature (`feat`), Refactor (`refactor`), or Chore (`chore`).
2. **Context**: Frame the issue within Canopy's architecture (Electron main/renderer, React UI, IPC).

### Step 2: Structure Issue Body

Use the following template for the issue body, adapting sections as necessary for clarity and completeness:

## Summary
[A concise, 1-2 sentence description of the issue or feature.]

## Problem Statement / Motivation
[Explain the problem this issue solves or the value this feature adds for Canopy users or developers.]

## Context
- **Affected Area(s)**: [e.g., Terminal, Worktree Management, IPC, UI Components, Build Process]
- **Relevant Files/Modules**: [List key files or modules that are likely to be involved, e.g., `src/components/Terminal/...`, `electron/services/PtyManager.ts`]
- **Existing Patterns**: [Refer to Canopy's established patterns, e.g., "Follows existing IPC patterns," "Integrates with Zustand store."]

## Proposed Solution / Approach (Optional)
[If a specific approach has been discussed or is evident, outline it here. Otherwise, state that the approach needs to be determined during implementation.]

## Implementation Guidance (Optional)
[A free-form comment that sums up more detailed implementation information and overall guidance provided during the request.]

## Deliverables
- [ ] Code changes addressing the core issue/feature.
- [ ] New or updated unit tests (`npm run test`).
- [ ] Updated documentation (if applicable).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `npm run check` passes cleanly (no linting, type-checking, or formatting errors).
- [ ] `npm run test` passes (all unit tests).
- [ ] [Specific, measurable criteria to confirm the issue is resolved or feature is implemented correctly, e.g., "New terminal instances display correct PTY information," "UI component renders as per design spec." ]

### Step 3: Create Issue

Use the `gh issue create` command with a conventional commit-style title:

`run_shell_command('gh issue create --title "[Type]: [Concise Title Summary]" --body "..."')`

**Title Format**:
- **Type**: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`.
- **Labels**: Apply appropriate labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `refactor`, `chore`, `documentation` using `gh issue edit {number} --add-label "label1,label2"`.

### Step 4: Report Success

Output the URL of the newly created GitHub issue.
